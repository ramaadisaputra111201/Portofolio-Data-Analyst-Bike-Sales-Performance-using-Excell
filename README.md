In this project, I analyzed retail sales data using Microsoft Excel to identify sales trends, top-performing products, and customer purchasing patterns. The process involved data cleaning, creating pivot tables, using lookup and statistical functions, and developing interactive dashboards with charts and slicers. The analysis provided insights into monthly sales performance, profit margins, and product category growth, helping to support data-driven business decisions.

Data Cleaning :
1. Removed 26 duplicate records.
2. Updated Marital Status values: “M” changed to Married and “S” changed to Single.
3. Updated Gender values: “F” changed to Female and “M” changed to Male.
4. Standardized Commute Distance by changing “10+ miles” to More than 10 miles.
5. Added a new column Age Bracket with the following rules Age > 55 “Old”; ≥ 31 “Middle”; < 31 “Adolescent”.

Exploratory Data Analys & Result :
1. Avg Income per Purchase: Shows that male customers have a higher average income ($58.907) compared to female customers ($52.900). Income tends to correlate positively with bike purchases.
2. Customer Age Brackets: Middle-aged customers represent the largest segment of bike buyers, followed by adolescents.
3. Customer Commute: Customers commuting 0–1 miles have the highest bike purchase rate, indicating that short-distance commuters are more likely to buy bikes.

Bussiness Insight :
1. Based on income, the company can target professionals and the upper-middle economic segment by offering loyalty programs or other incentive initiatives.
2. From the age perspective, product innovation can be developed for younger and older segments by improving design, comfort, and practicality, as well as providing affordable pricing to increase purchase interest.
3. In addition, the company can promote its products in urban areas with short-distance mobility or high population density, and conduct regional research based on commute distance to open new branches or stores.
